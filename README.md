Learn and practice Regression Analysis

Dataset Used : "Cars" from SAS

Do the following analyses using the “Cars” dataset of the SAS. 

Part One- Simple Regression Model 

1.	Choose a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X) from the “Cars” dataset.
2.	Explain about the relationship between X and Y in form of equation by using SAS software
3.	Plot the regression line
4.	Interpret the R-squared

Part Two-  Multiple Regression Model
1.	Choose a number of independent variables (n more than 5) and a dependent variable from the dataset. These independent variables will be used to predict the dependent variable.
2.	Find the relationship between the variables using multiple regression modeling and SAS
3.	Check the model in term of correlation between the independent variables
4.	Interpret the standard errors
5.	Interpret the R-squired of the model
6.	Check the overall confidence by testing and using p-value. Explain it.
